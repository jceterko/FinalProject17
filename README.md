""" This game is based on the show Supernatural. You will play as one of 3 character choices: Sam, Dean or Castiel. You will go through 3 stages. In each stage you will encounter a supernatural being. In order to pass each of these stages you must beat the supernatural being by answering a series of questions related to the show. The questions will get harder as the game goes on. Once all three stages are passed, you have won the game.
